## Installation

## Roadmap


## Contributing


Tell the new developer how to use the GitHub repo to begin working on your web app, including:

* What does the developer need to install (donâ€™t leave anything out!) like:
language(s)
IDEs
Database(s)
Other software

* Which 3rd party APIs and frameworks does the developer need to download?
* Do they need any API keys?
* In which order should they install things? Does installation location matter?
* Include detailed configuration instructions and any additional notes including passwords to servers, etc.
* Include a link to the testing plan you have completed so the new developer can see your testing history and maybe contribute to a minor bug fix!
