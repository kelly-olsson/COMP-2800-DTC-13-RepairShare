## Contributing-and-Installation

To begin working on RepairShare, you should be ready to rely heavily on Jquery, Javascript, CSS, and HTML.

We built this application on Visual Studio Code, and recommend that incoming developers also use this IDE. 

RepairShare is built around Firebase. This online database allows for the storage of messages, user skills, personal information and tools. 

As a result, Firebase is an integral aspect of RepairShare. A strong working knowledge of Firebase and the way in which other google APIs (google maps) is a nessecary component for meaningful commitments to the RepairShare source code. 

If you wish to wade gently into firebase, we recommend you review our code on provider-profile.js. This code shows the way in which we read, write, and filter through our database.
