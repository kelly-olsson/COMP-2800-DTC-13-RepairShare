## Content
Content of the project folder:

## Tell the new developer how to use the GitHub repo to begin working on your web app, including:

* What does the developer need to install (donâ€™t leave anything out!) like:
language(s)
IDEs
Database(s)
Other software

* Which 3rd party APIs and frameworks does the developer need to download?
* Do they need any API keys?
* In which order should they install things? Does installation location matter?
* Include detailed configuration instructions and any additional notes including passwords to servers, etc.
* Include a link to the testing plan you have completed so the new developer can see your testing history and maybe contribute to a minor bug fix!


## We will be looking for the following when we examining your code:

* App organization, i.e., files are organized into subdirectories, JS/CSS is externally linked
* Modularity, i.e., classes are coherent and loosely coupled, functions are atomic, etc.
* Architecture, i.e., there is a clear distinction between model (database), view (presentation), and controller (server side)
* Your code style, variable names, indentation, commenting, etc. is consistent and meet or exceed BCIT and industry standards
* There is evidence of testing, i.e., unit tests (how we do love unit tests!), user testing, results, etc.
* Thoughtful and correct use of GitHub, meaningful commit comments, and consistent application of the gitflow workflow.
